# Research Question:

How much more money are real estate developers willing to pay for properties that are easily accessible to the NYC subway system?

# Background

Residential Real Estate can be divided into two primary actors:


1. Renters - Exchange $ for ability to reside in a unit within the building.


2. Firms - Real Estate Firms who own Residential Buildings.

### Renters

The renters enter the market looking for an apartment to rent. They make their decision based on a variety of factors such as distance to locations of interest (LOI) such as work, entertainment, public transportation. Based on the bundle of these factors, they formulate a Willingness To Pay (WTP), which is the maximum they would be willing to pay for a given apartment. 


### Firms

I assume that the firms are rational profit-maximizers. The profit function for a firm looks like:


Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs
Profit = (Price * Quantity) - (Fixed Costs + Variable Costs)
